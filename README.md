## Lessons Learned

The project started out with a simple inefficient implementation of the ratings/popularity based sorting feature. This taught me how to **sort information stored in a DataFrame** according to different conditions.

The next part was the content-based searching feature. I had to go through a whole bunch of **different metrics and types of NLP models to get the most accurate results** that I could.

The third feature was implemented in the form of personalised recommendations based on a user's ratings for different movies. **Several similarity metrics had to be tried and tested to implement an approach similar to KNN** but in a much more elegant and simplified manner.

Last but not the least, a major part of the development cycle was spent in making the app more user friendly in general and in using several **optimisation techniques like caching** to make the experience smoother for the user.
**Web scraping** also played a major role as gathering accurate data was a much more crucial and tedious task as compared to implementing ML models based on that data.
